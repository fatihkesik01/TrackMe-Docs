# Development Phases

## Current State

**Phase 18 complete.** 64 EF Core migrations. Athletes can now set their nutrition data to Private, blocking trainer read access to nutrition goals, logs, and meals. `nutrition_visibility` column added to `athletes`; `CoachOnly` is the default.

- `POST /api/progress-photos` — multipart upload with metadata fields
- `GET /api/progress-photos` — own paginated list
- `GET /api/athletes/{athleteId}/progress-photos` — trainer view (CoachOnly + Public, requires accepted coaching relationship)

- `GET /api/submissions/{id}` — detail with feedbacks
- `POST /api/submissions/{id}/feedback` — trainer video/audio feedback
- `PATCH /api/submissions/{id}/feedback/{feedbackId}/viewed` — athlete marks feedback viewed
- `DELETE /api/submissions/{id}` and `DELETE /api/submissions/{id}/feedback/{feedbackId}`
- Notifications: `SubmissionReceived`, `FeedbackReceived`
- Web: Athlete Submissions view + trainer Videos tab in Athlete Detail

### Phase 10 — Nutrition Tracking MVP

- `NutritionGoal` entity for active calorie/protein/carbs/fat targets
- `DailyNutritionLog` entity with unique `(athlete_id, date)` and API upsert behavior
- Nutrition endpoints: goals, logs, athlete history, trainer history, and summary
- Athlete Nutrition view: today progress bars, log modal, 30-day adherence grid
- Trainer Athlete Detail Nutrition tab: set/update goal and last-30-day adherence list
- Dashboard Nutrition Today card for athletes with an active goal

### Phase 11 — Exercise Demo Videos

- Nullable `exercises.demo_video_media_asset_id` FK to `media_assets`
- Trainer upload/delete for owned private exercises; admin upload/delete for global exercises
- MP4/WebM validation through the existing Phase 9 video media pipeline
- Public media proxy playback for `MediaPurpose.ExerciseVideo`
- Demo video controls in the exercise library, program exercise picker, and WorkoutMode

### Phase 12 — Nutrition Meals

- `FoodItem`, `Meal`, and `MealEntry` entities with fully snake_case PostgreSQL mappings
- Searchable global/custom food library with barcode uniqueness and 52 seeded Turkish staples
- Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack containers with gram-based macro calculation at save time
- Athlete meal CRUD and computed day totals without overwriting manual `DailyNutritionLog` values
- Trainer read-only daily meal history guarded by accepted coaching relationships
- Athlete meal cards, food search/custom food modal, date navigation, and trainer meal view

### Phase 13 — Admin Audit Log

- `AdminAuditLog` entity (`actor_user_id`, `action`, `target_user_id`, `target_email`, `detail`, `ip_address`, `created_at`)
- Logged actions: `user.update`, `user.deactivate`, `exercise.restore`, `exercise.seed`, `data.reset`
- `GET /api/admin/audit-log` — paginated list, filterable by `action`
- Admin panel: Audit Log card with action filter dropdown
- IP address captured per request; logs saved atomically within each admin action

### Phase 14 — Progress Photo Body Metric Linking

- Nullable `progress_photos.body_metric_id` FK with `ON DELETE SET NULL`
- Upload and patch ownership validation for athlete body metrics
- Full nine-field body metric snapshots in athlete and trainer photo lightboxes
- Before/after comparison includes per-field metric deltas
- Upload modal can select from the athlete's existing dated body measurements

### Phase 15 — Missed Activity Notifications

- `MissedActivityAlert` entity records trainer, athlete, alert type, and sent timestamp
- Daily `MissedActivityAlertService` checks accepted coaching relationships
- Workout alerts require an active program and no completed session for more than 7 days
- Nutrition alerts require an active goal and no daily log for more than 3 days
- Per trainer/athlete/type suppression prevents duplicate workout alerts for 7 days and nutrition alerts for 3 days
- Notifications are persisted and pushed through the existing SignalR notification channel

### Phase 16 — Media Reporting & Moderation

- `ReportedByUserId`, `ReportedAt`, `ReportReason` nullable fields added to `media_assets`
- `POST /api/media/{id}/report` — any authenticated user can flag media they don't own
- Cannot report own media, already-rejected, or already-hidden assets
- `GET /api/admin/media/reported` — paginated list of all reported assets with owner and reporter names
- `PATCH /api/admin/media/{id}/moderate` — admin sets moderation status to `Approved`, `Rejected`, or `Hidden`; audit-logged as `media.moderate`
- Admin panel: new Media Moderation card with inline approve/hide/reject buttons

### Phase 17 — Athlete Templates

- `athlete_id` nullable FK added to `program_templates` (alongside existing `trainer_id`)
- Athletes can create their own day templates and program templates
- `GET /api/templates` — filters by caller's trainer ID **or** athlete ID; admin sees all
- `POST /api/templates` — athletes set `athlete_id`; trainers set `trainer_id`; admin leaves both null
- Full CRUD, day/exercise management, apply-to-day/apply-to-program — all ownership checks updated to support athletes
- `OwnerName` field replaces `TrainerName` in DTOs (shows trainer, athlete, or "System")
- `ResolveAthleteProfileIdAsync` helper added to `TemplateEndpoints`

### Phase 18 — Nutrition Privacy

- `nutrition_visibility` varchar(20) column added to `athletes` with default `CoachOnly`
- `NutritionVisibility` enum: `CoachOnly = 0` (default), `Private = 1`; stored as string in DB
- Trainer read access blocked when `Private`: `GetGoal`, `GetAthleteLogs` (NutritionEndpoints), `GetAthleteMeals` (MealEndpoints)
- Goal write (`SetGoal`, `UpdateGoal`) intentionally NOT blocked — coaching write actions remain accessible
- `PATCH /api/auth/profile` accepts optional `nutritionVisibility: "Private" | "CoachOnly"`
- `GET /api/auth/me` returns `nutritionVisibility` string for authenticated athletes
- ProfileView: athlete-only radio card (between Privacy Settings and Featured Exercises) with TR/EN i18n
